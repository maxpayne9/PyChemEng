PyChemEng
=========

A set of python scripts which help perform chemical engineering tasks,
such as mass balances, energy balances, and chemical reaction
equilibrium calculations.

Examples/Documentation
========

Please take a look at the Examples.py file.

Testing
=======

You can validate the entire set of calculations by running the
Tests.py script.
